We chose to use the technology stack Django. For our project, we needed to build a web application that needs to store and retrieve data from a database. With Django, we were able to define database using Python classes, and Django took care of creating necessary relationships in the database. 
Also, Django provides a lot of built-in functionality for common web application tasks such as user authentication and URL routing. This saved us a lot of time and effort since we did not have to build features from scratch. 
Also, we chose Django over the other technology stack since Django is popular and well-established web framework, we were able to find lot of resources online for learning and troubleshooting.
